This folder contains the sources (JAVA) of a small app that generates a difficulty settings file from a String.

The String mentioned is acquired from TLD : when you create a custom difficulty and share it, TLD gives you a String.

This folder deals with the settings file creation.

This folder is more of a convenience thing. It has no effect on the Patching of TLD's challenges.

The JAVA version used is 1.8
