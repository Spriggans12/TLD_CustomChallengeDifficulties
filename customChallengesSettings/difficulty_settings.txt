# This is a settings file that contains all the variables from the "Custom difficulty" screen in TLD.
# Each parameter can here be set. These parameters will define the difficulty of all the challenges you play.
# That way, you can finally simulate a custom difficulty on challenges.
#
# Some parameters are not smart to use in challenges, like the choice of the starting location or the no-rifle spawn.
# => These parameters are not used by the Patch if the Challenge loaded needs specific settings.
# For example, it is possible to start Nomad in any location you want. But in other challenges, you can't.
# Another example, in white-out, you can't turn off Rifle-spawn, as you need it to finish the challenge.
# 
# In this file, you will find a list, as seen in game, of all the parameters one could set.
# For each parameter, you must use of the possible commented values.
# /!\ !!Beware!! 
#     -> Parameters are case sensitive ! So "High" and "high" are not the same thing. Using wrong case makes the Patch not work.
#     -> All parameters must be set. Even specific parameters like starting location.
# 
# Lines that start with a # are ignored.
